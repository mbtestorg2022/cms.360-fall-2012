"_Civic media is any form of communication that strengthens the social bonds within a community or creates a strong sense of civic engagement among its residents._" — MIT Center for Civic Media

Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lecture: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course examines civic media in comparative, transnational and historical perspectives. We will explore various theoretical tools, research approaches, and project design methods. Students will engage with multimedia texts on concepts such as citizen journalism, transmedia activism, media justice, and civic, public, radical, and tactical media. Case studies focus on civic media across platforms (print, radio, broadcast, internet), contexts (from local to global, present-day to historical), and use (dialogic, contentious, hacktivist). As a final project, students develop a paper, case study, or civic media project design. Students taking the graduate version complete additional assignments. Limited to 20 students.

"_The need for a 21st century freedom discourse is paramount. The Obama campaign proved that the connection of media technology and organizing holds much promise for constructing electoral movements. Now, how can that technology help us construct new spaces for black and other subaltern voice? Which tools and platforms will help collective deliberation and debate, not just aggregate or pass on information? What venues and mechanisms will aid formation of political identities of dispersed and despised groups? How can these groups find opportunities for speech back to the majority?"_ — Dayna Cunningham

Course Goals
------------

Students who complete Introduction to Civic Media will be able to:

*   Understand key concepts in the field of Civic Media, for example: public sphere; networked counterpublics; citizen journalism; radical media; media justice; hacktivism.
*   Articulate and defend their own definition of the term "Civic Media."
*   Assess common arguments about the role of digital media technologies in social change.

*   Understand, and explain to others, what's new and what's not so new about the 'new media' debates.
*   Conceive, develop, and present a final civic media project.

Learning Tools and Activities
-----------------------------

In addition to reading and in-class discussion, participants in this course will work together intensively thro ghout the semester to develop a shared practice of real-time collaborative note-taking, writing & editing, and public participation in debates about civic media via the course blog.

Learning activities include:

*   Engage with class texts and discussions;
*   Lead a class discussion;
*   Take shared notes via etherpad;
*   Transform shared discussion notes into blog posts;
*   Write posts summarizing key positions in civic media debates;
*   Conduct peer review of each others' work, via in-class feedback and the blog;
*   Write a short case study about a civic mapping project;
*   Find an example of a failed civic media project, and write a post about what it was, how and why it failed, and by what criteria it is considered a failure;
*   Create and present a final project proposal midway through the semester;
*   Create and present a final project at the end of the term.

_"There is no guarantee that networked information technology will lead to the improvements in innovation, freedom, and justice that I suggest are possible. That is a choice we face as a society. The way we develop will, in significant measure, depend on choices we make in the next decade or so." —_ Yochai Benkler_, The Wealth of Networks: How Social Production Transforms Markets and Freedom_.
